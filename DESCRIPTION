Description: gnomeR: Prepare raw IMPACT and TCGA mutation data for analysis. Annotate OncoKB, summarize maf files, visualize results and more.      
  OncoCast: is an ensemble learner relying on cross-validation for high dimensional survival data. The algorithm can handle left truncated (delayed entry) data for all available methods. Multiple regression methods can be used including LASSO, elastic-net or generalized boosted regression.
    Originally developed to stratify cancer patients based on their genomic profile. Through cross-validation we generate an average predictive risk score that acts as a surrogate for the aggregated effects of the profile of each patients. We include an interactive R based application that enables the user to explore the results in various ways. More details can be found in the vignette included in the package.
  panelmap: is a visual aid to represent grouped data and its corresponding variables in the form of a panel.
    Each row of a panelmap is called a panelet. panelmap can also output association tests to identify trends in the dataset.
  survClust: is an outcome weighted clustering algorithm used to classify multi-omic samples on their available time to event information.
